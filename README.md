## Project Overview

### Data Exploration

The initial exploration involves loading the dataset and understanding its structure and content. This includes:

- Reading the dataset using Pandas.
- Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
- Generating summary statistics for numerical columns.
- Checking for null values and data types.

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. This includes:

- Filling null values.
- Selecting relevant columns.
- Saving the cleaned data to a new CSV file.

### Data Analysis

The analysis involves examining various aspects of the dataset to uncover insights. This includes:

- Identifying and handling outliers.
- Analyzing the distribution of movie ratings.
- Examining the relationship between movie genres and ratings.
- Analyzing the distribution of gross earnings.

### Data Visualization

Visualizations are created to represent the findings graphically. This includes:

- Histograms for univariate analysis.
- Pie charts for genre distribution.
- Box plots for rating distribution by genre.
- Bar plots for average gross revenue by genre.
